        </ol>
        <li>3/4 cup (170g) lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (14g) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups +2 tablespoons (240g + 14g) King Arthur unbleached Bread Flour,divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <ol><em><strong><span class="enhance" >"Instructions"</span></strong></em>
        <span class="instructions"><li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.</li></span>
          <span class="instructions"><li>Combine all the ingredients, using 2 cups (240g) of the flour, in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the padde attachment, mix on medium speed to make a shaggy dough. This will only take about 30 to 45 seconds; turn the mixer off to scrape the bowl midway.</li></span>
            <span class="instructions"><li>Place the 2 tablespoons (14g) of flour in a mound on your work surface and use some of it to lightly dust a 12"-round surface and knead it by hand, incorporating more flour from the additional 2 tablespoons as needed, until the dough feels springy and just slightly tacky,about 2 to 3 minutes.</li></span>
         <span class="instructions"> <li>Leave the dough on the lightly floured surface; there should be a bit of flour left over from the original 2 tablespoons. Place your mixing bowl upside-down over the dough, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li></span>
         <span class="instructions"> <li>Divide the dough into eight equal pieces; each piece should weigh betweem 55g and 60g. Form each piece into a ball, cover them, and let them rest for 5 minutes</li></span>
          <span class="instructions"> <li>In the meantime, place a large skillet (12" or larger is ideal) on the stovetop and preheat it over medium heat. Alternatively, preheat an electric griddle to 325F</li></span>
          <span class="instructions"> <li>Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll it into a rough circle or oval about 1/4" thick and 6" in diameter, using more flour if nessesary</li></span>
          <span class="instructions"> <li>Dry-fry (no oil) the flatbreads in batches of two to four in the skillet or on the griddle. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on one side, or until golden brown, then flip and cook the second side for another 2 minutes. Transfer the flatbreads from the pan to a rack to cool slightly before serving.</li></span>
           <span class="instructions"><li>Store flatbreads, well wrapped, at room temperature</li></span>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ol class="enhance"><strong><em>"Big Batch Quick Dinner Rolls" </em></strong></ol>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>2 cups (454g) milk, warm (100°F to 110°F)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (43g) butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (21g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons (28g) yeast, instant yeast preferred</li>
        <li>6 to 7 cups (723g to 843g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li class="instructions">Combine the water, milk, butter, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl, or the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir well and let sit for 6 to 8 minutes, or until you see the yeast begin to foam.</li>
        <li class="instructions">Add 5 cups of flour and mix by hand or with the paddle attachment until the dough forms a rough, shaggy mass. The dough will not form a ball at this point, but will be just shy of coming together.</li>
        <li class="instructions">Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time and blend with the dough hook until a smooth ball begins to form. Knead by hand for about 10 minutes, or by machine for 4 to 5 minutes until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch.</li>
        <li class="instructions">Lightly spray your work bowl with cooking spray and place the dough in the bowl. Spritz the top of the dough with spray as well and cover lightly with plastic wrap or a shower cap. Let rise for 20 minutes at room temperature or until the dough is full and puffy.</li>
        <li class="instructions">Gently deflate the dough and pat out to a rough rectangle about 8 inches by 12 inches. Cut the dough into 4 long strips, then cut each strip into 6 portions for a total of 24 dough balls. Shape into round balls as you would shape meatballs, using your cupped hands to roll the dough. Spritz your hands with cooking spray to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li class="instructions">You can place the rolls into any of the following pans, well greased or lined with parchment paper: One half-sheet baking pan or 2 quarter-sheet pans. Two 13" x 9" x 2" pans. Four 8" or 9" round baking pans OR a combination of any of these pans.</li>
        <li class="instructions">After the rolls are in the pans, cover again with your plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for another 20 to 25 minutes, or until well rounded and full looking. If you are baking now, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li class="instructions">Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and an internal thermometer reads 190°F. You can brush the baked rolls with melted butter if desired. Serve warm, store leftovers in a plastic bag for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li class="instrcutions">If you want to freeze the unbaked buns, place in the pans as described in step 6 and allow to rise for 10 minutes. Wrap airtight and freeze for up to 4 weeks. To bake, thaw overnight in the fridge, then unwrap and bake as directed.</li>

        <ol class="enhance"><strong><em>"Savory Cheddar Cheese Biscuits"</em></strong>
      </ol>
        <li>2 cups (227g) King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour</li>
        <li>4 ounces (113g) cheddar cheese, the sharper the better; we prefer Cabot extra-sharp</li>
        <li> cup (227g) heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="enhance"><strong><em>"Instructions"</em></strong></ul>
        <ol>
          <li class="instrcutions">Preheat your oven to 425°F, with a rack in the upper third.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">To make the biscuits using a food processor: Cut the cheese into a few chunks. Place the cheese and flour into the work bowl of your food processor.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Process until the mixture is smooth; the cheese will be very finely chopped.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Add the cream, and pulse until the dough becomes cohesive. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">To make the dough by hand: Grate or shred the cheese; you should have about 1 cup. Toss it together with the flour.</li>
          <li class="instrcutions">Add the cream, stirring to make a cohesive dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.</li>
          <li>Pat the dough into a disc 3/4" to 1" thick; the thicker the disc, the taller the biscuits.</li>
          <li>Use a 2" cutter (or the size of your choice) to cut rounds. Place the biscuits on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops of the biscuits with cream or milk; this will help brown their crust.</li>
          <li>Bake the biscuits for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and serve immediately.</li>
